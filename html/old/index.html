          <p>NASA's Juno spacecraft brouth us these amazing images of the "long-lived anticyclonic" storm named North North Temperate Little Red Spot or NN-LRS-1 for short. Scientists have been tracking this storm since 1993, but dont truly know when it
            originated. This image is from July 10, 2017.</p>

          <h2>On Learning</h2>
          <p>"Well, thank you for noticing that, because there’s a difference between talking at someone and speaking with them. These are two different exercises. One of them is, “You don’t know and I know, so just shut up and listen,” and the other one
            is, you’re curious and you’re learning, and I have a way where you can learn this so you’ll know it as well." </p>
          <p class="primary-txt">"And when you know it, and know why you know it, then you don't have to reference me ever again because you take ownership of the knowledge, and you can then share it with someone else. They’ll say, “Well how do you know that?” Well, it’s because
            A goes to B and this has the cause and effect. But if your answer could only be, “‘Cause Tyson told me,” I failed. You want to somehow get that inside you, and then you raise a notch in your knowledge, enlightenment, wisdom, and insight into
            the operations of the world"</p>

          <h2>SLS - The most powerful rocket... EVER.</h2>
          <p>NASA’s Space Launch System will be the most powerful rocket we’ve ever built. When completed, SLS will enable astronauts to begin their journey to explore destinations far into the solar system. Production of the five-segment powerhouse motors
            for the Space Launch System (SLS) solid rocket boosters is on target at prime contractor Orbital ATK’s facilities in Utah, with 10 motor segments cast with propellant and four of those segments complete. Following propellant casting, the finished
            segments were evaluated using non-destructive techniques, such as x-ray, to ensure they met quality standards, and the exterior cases were painted white with black-and-white photogrammetric markings. All motor segments will ultimately be shipped
            to Kennedy Space Center, where they will be integrated with forward and aft booster structures and then with the SLS core stage.</p>
